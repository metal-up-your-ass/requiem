## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Project bootstrap: README, license, contributing guide, architecture and build docs, ADRs, and CI workflow.
- DSP core: initial working Requiem signal path with unit tests (Decay/Damping-driven procedural impulse response, Pre-Delay, Width, latency-compensated Dry/Wet Mix, Output trim, optional user impulse-response override).
- **Space** parameter (Cathedral/Hall/Chamber): shapes a discrete early-reflection tap layer ahead of the diffuse late tail, generated procedurally alongside the existing Decay/Damping-driven tail.
- **Early/Late Balance** parameter: equal-power crossfade between the early-reflection layer and the diffuse late tail baked into the generated impulse response.
- **Freeze** parameter: sustains the tail's current spectral content (flat envelope, full gain, early-reflection layer suppressed) instead of letting it decay, bounded to the Decay setting.
- **Modulation** parameter: a subtle post-convolution `juce::dsp::Chorus`-based movement applied to the wet tail only, to soften metallic ringing/add richness; 0% is a bit-identical passthrough and adds no reported latency.
- Robust user impulse-response loading: candidate files are validated (readable audio, ≤30 s) via a dedicated `juce::AudioFormatReader` check before being handed to `juce::dsp::Convolution`, rejecting unreadable or pathologically long files without altering engine state.
- Editor controls for all four new parameters (a `ComboBox` for Space, rotary sliders for Early/Late Balance and Modulation, a toggle button for Freeze), fully wired via APVTS attachments.
- Expanded Catch2 test suite (26 -> 48 tests): sample-rate sweeps (44.1-192 kHz) for the null test and general processing, mono/stereo bus-layout coverage (including `isBusesLayoutSupported()` accept/reject checks), long-run NaN/Inf stability runs under continuous full-parameter automation, and dedicated coverage for every new DSP feature (Space, Early/Late Balance, Freeze, Modulation, robust user-IR loading).
- `docs/manual.md`: a full user manual (signal flow, complete parameter reference with musical descriptions, mix-placement guidance, and usage tips).

### Changed

- Signal flow: Modulation (chorus, wet-only) now sits between Convolution and Width.
- `docs/architecture.md`, `README.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` updated to describe the expanded signal path and parameter set.
